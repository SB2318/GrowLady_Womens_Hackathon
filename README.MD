# Solution for Azure Hackathon

This is a small effort to make education easier not only for women but also for ordinary people. It can be called the prototype of an application.
It still has a lot of implementation left. Due to lack of access to **Azure services**, no azure services were used here.
But the In the future implementation  I want to shift from **Firebase** to **Microsoft Blob storage.** 
Although the authentication part is not well implemented here, I hope to start the work of shifting from authentication.

For now, it is an application that allows users to access or upload Videos and Ebooks. And they can also download their respective Ebooks.

Clicking on any one of the class cards here will give them the information they need.
