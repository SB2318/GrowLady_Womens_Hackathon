# Solution for Azure Hackathon (Admin Projects)

This is a small effort to make education easier not only for women but also for ordinary people. It can be called the prototype of an application.
It still has a lot of implementation left. Due to lack of access to **Azure services**, no azure services were used here.
But the In the future implementation  I want to shift from **Firebase** to **Microsoft Blob storage.** 
Although the authentication part is not well implemented here, I hope to start the work of shifting from authentication.

For now, it is an application that allows users to access or upload Videos and Ebooks. And they can also download their respective Ebooks.

# Future Implementation:
---
1. Make Admin app more secure
2. Implement  QR code feature
3. Manage admin and user access (already give a logic in the user application.)
4. Convert whole project into **Single Activity Architectutre**.
5. Convert user and admin project to **MVVM**
6. Move on to **Microsoft Blob Storage(When I get the access)**
7. Make UI great.
